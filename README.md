# Introducing an Evolved Neuron for Human Activity Recognition
## Empirical Study on Performance and Generalization
Under the supervision of Prof. Roland Olsson

The thesis is established as a pilot study that concentrates on neuron exploration, which is comprised of analyzing its logic, importing it to other frameworks such as TensorFlow, and evaluating its accuracy. 
The selected neuron is version 30th in the synthesized list for HAR using the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) dataset, which is the second best in both complexity and accuracy.

Folder Description:
1. [bash_script](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/bash_scripts) provides the implementing script to run the neurons training and testing in parallel.
2. [notebooks](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/notebooks) provides implementation of the neuron in TensorFlow framework as the JupyterLab notebooks.
3. [pythons](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/pythons) provides implementation of the neuron in TensorFlow framework as the Python files.
4. [pareto](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/pareto) provides the list of evolved neurons for WISDM datasets, which later is used for drawing the Pareto Frontier graph.
5. [params](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/params) provides the tuned hyperparameter for different datasets.
6. [params](https://github.com/AchillesProject/MasterThesis/tree/main/params) provides the results of different trials before being cleaned up. [Can be discarded]
