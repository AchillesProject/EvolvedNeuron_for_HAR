1-9/11/2021: Researching about how to implement new network with Tensorflow/Keras

<<<<<<< HEAD

+ It is inherrited from the base layer tf.keras.layers.Layer
+ The implementation is saved at ./RNNplus_v1.ipynb
+ The results is saved at ./results/2_rnn_plus/rnn_plus_v1_10112021
+ The logs is saved at ./logs/processing/2_rnn_plus/rnnplus_v1_10112021

15/11/2021: [Script] Run RNNplus_v1 for all 180 small datasets and merge results with the original LSTM
+ Notebook file: ./MergingResults_v1.ipynb

+ Results: 
 ++ For rolled setting: ./results/2_rnn_plus/rnn_plus_v1_15112021_ES_DS_Rolled
 ++ For unrolled setting: ./results/2_rnn_plus/rnn_plus_v1_15112021_ES_DS_UnRolled

 ++ For rolled setting: ./results/2_rnn_plus/rnn_plus_v1_15112021_ES_DS_UnRolled_merged

--> Problem: The results from the RNN_plus_v1 are not good as the original LSTM or the Prof's result.
--> Hypothesis: Missing the configuration for optimizing the Adam function compared to the implementation from professors.

30/11/2021: [Notebook] Adding the tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule and changing the other parameters such as beta_1, beta_2, and epsilon.
+ Notebook file: ./RNNplus_v1_1.ipynb
+ Results: 
 ++ For unrolled setting: ./results/2_rnn_plus/rnn_plus_v1_30112021_ES_DS_UnRolled_LS

***Note: Rolled and Unrolled will generate different graphs.

10/12/2021: [Notebook] Update the code with dynamic hyperparams, which are:
* Getting hyperparameters from a text file stored in ./params folder.
* Number of Units equals to the combination of inputs and outputs -> epochs = noInput + noOutput
* Number of Epochs equals to the dividine between numTrainingSteps and batchSize -> epochs = numTrainingSteps / trainsetSize / batchSize
Updating the CustomMetrics function to work with tensor -> it can be worked with batchsizer larger than 1.
